## üéØ Project Goal

### Complete Management of DnD Combat Sessions.

The backend is designed to offer complete management of combat sessions in "_Dungeons & Dragons 5e_", integrating directly with character created by players and npc sheets created by the master. These are created through the dedicated Flutter application, "_SchedaDnD5e_", which serves as the frontend for interaction with the system.

### Main Backend Features

1. **Combat Session Management**.
   - **Creation and Update**: Allows the creation of new combat sessions and the update of existing sessions. Each session includes attributes such as name, session status, map size, and participants (characters, NPCs, monsters).
   - **Status Monitoring**: Manages and updates session status (created, in progress, paused, ended), and maintains event history via historical messages.

2. **Entity Management**
   - **Characters and Monsters**: Manages character and monster sheets and their variations during combat. Such variations can include, for example, decreased HP, spell castings with consumable slots, and much more allowed by the game rules. Each entity can also have a reaction status with respect to other entities that can be enabled or disabled during play.
   - **Turn Management**: Monitors and updates the states and positions of entities during game turns, keeping track of their location on the map and turn index.

3. **Real-Time Interaction**
   - **WebSocket for Real-Time Updates**: Uses WebSocket to provide real-time updates during combat sessions. This includes handling dice rolls and other actions that require instant interactions between players and the master.
   - **Synchronization**: Ensures that all changes made by player actions or status changes are synchronized in real time with the frontend, enhancing the interactive gaming experience.

4. **Authentication and Security**
   - **JWT for Authentication**: Uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to manage user authentication. This ensures that only authorized users can access and modify combat sessions and entities.

5. **Performance and Caching**
   - **Data Caching**: Implements a caching system through Redis to improve the performance of frequent requests and reduce the load on the database. Temporarily stores information for quick access without having to query Sequelize or Firestore each time.
   - **Error Management and Feedback**: Provides clear and detailed responses for common errors, such as entities not found or attempts at impermissible actions.

6. **Persistence and Synchronization**.
   - **Data Persistence**: Ensures that all changes to entities and sessions are saved in the database. Uses Sequelize for data management, ensuring persistent and consistent updates.
   - **Synchronization with Frontend**: Maintains data synchronization between the backend and frontend, ensuring that changes to sessions and entities are reflected in real time in the user interface.

### Actors
The player roles can be mapped as follows. Note that although the client must be authenticated via JWT to participate in the combat session, there is still a route that does not require authentication, namely the `diceRoll/` route.

## ü™Ñ Patterns Used

Various software design patterns were used in the implementation to ensure a robust, maintainable and scalable code structure. The following are the patterns used:

<a name="Middleware"></a>
### Middleware

The middleware pattern is used extensively in this application to address various concerns such as validation, authentication and authorisation in a modular and systematic way.

**Why Middleware**?  
- **Separation of concerns**: Allows for a clear separation of different concerns in the request processing pipeline. Each middleware function is responsible for a specific task - whether it's validating input parameters, checking user credentials or handling errors - making the codebase cleaner and easier to manage.
- **Reusability**: Functions can be reused across multiple paths and endpoints. For example, validation middleware that checks for mandatory parameters and their types can be applied to different endpoints, reducing code duplication and promoting consistency.
- **Flexibility** and extensibility: Middleware can be easily added, removed or modified without affecting other parts of the application. This flexibility supports modular feature development and simplifies testing and debugging.

In practice, at the dice roll endpoint, for example, middleware functions perform essential tasks such as verifying the presence of required parameters, validating their data types, and performing specific checks before the main dice roll logic is executed. This approach not only streamlines request handling, but also centralises logic for common operations.

<a name="Factory"></a>
### Factory Method

The Factory Method pattern is used to create error objects, encapsulating the instantiation logic and providing a centralised way to generate different types of errors. This pattern helps to maintain a clean and organised code structure, ensuring that error handling is consistent and standardised across the application.

**Why Factory Method?** 
- **Encapsulating the creation logic**: By using factory methods to create error objects, the instantiation logic is encapsulated within dedicated classes. This approach hides the complexity of error creation and provides a simple interface for error creation.
- **Consistency and standardisation**: Factory methods ensure that errors are created in a consistent manner, following a standardised format and structure. This consistency is essential for effective bug handling and debugging.
- **Centralised error management**: With factory methods, bug creation is managed from a single location, making it easier to handle different types of bugs consistently. This centralisation simplifies maintenance and makes it easier to update the error handling logic.

For example, different factory classes are used to generate client-side and server-side errors, allowing the application to handle different error scenarios in a structured way. This ensures that error responses are unambiguous and appropriately reflect the nature of the problem.

<a name="RepFacSingleton"></a>
### Repository + Factory + Singleton

The data sources in the application are managed using a combination of the Repository, Factory and Singleton patterns. These patterns work together to abstract data access, manage the creation of data handling objects and ensure efficient resource management.

**Repository Pattern**:  
- **Abstraction of data access**: The Repository Pattern abstracts the data layer, providing a clean API for interacting with different data sources. This abstraction separates the data access logic from the business logic, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.
- Caching and Efficiency**: Repositories include caching functionality (e.g. using Redis) to improve performance by reducing redundant data retrieval operations. This caching mechanism helps to speed up access to frequently used data.

- **Factory Pattern**:  
- **Centralised repository creation**: The factory pattern is used to create repository instances for different models. This centralised creation logic ensures that repositories are built consistently and simplifies the management of different data stores.
- **Flexibility and Scalability**: By using a factory to build repositories, the system can easily adapt to changes in data store technologies or requirements without significant changes to the code base.

**Singleton Pattern**:  
- **Single Source of Truth**: The singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of each repository is used throughout the application. This guarantees a single source of truth for data access and reduces the overhead associated with multiple instances.
- **Resource Management**: Managing a single instance of a repository helps to conserve resources and maintain a consistent state across the application. It also simplifies the handling of connections and transactions.

Together, these patterns enable efficient data retrieval, management, and persistence across various storage solutions such as Redis, Sequelize, and Firestore.
